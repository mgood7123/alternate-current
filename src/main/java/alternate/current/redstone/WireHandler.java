/**
 * This class handles power changes for redstone wire. The algorithm
 * was designed with the following goals in mind:
 * <br>
 * 1. Minimize the number of times a wire checks its surroundings to
 *    determine its power level.
 * <br>
 * 2. Minimize the number of block and shape updates emitted.
 * <br>
 * 3. Emit block and shape updates in a deterministic, non-locational
 *    order, fixing bug MC-11193.
 *
 * <p>
 * In Vanilla redstone wire is laggy because it fails on points 1 and 2.
 *
 * <p>
 * Redstone wire updates recursively and each wire calculates its power
 * level in isolation rather than in the context of the network it is a
 * part of. This means a wire in a grid can change its power level over
 * half a dozen times before settling on its final value. This problem
 * used to be worse in 1.14 and below, where a wire would only decrease
 * its power level by 1 at a time.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to this, a wire emits 42 block updates and up to 22 shape
 * updates each time it changes its power level.
 *
 * <p>
 * Of those 42 block updates, 6 are to itself, which are thus not only
 * redundant, but a big source of lag, since those cause the wire to
 * unnecessarily re-calculate its power level. A block only has 24
 * neighbors within a Manhattan distance of 2, meaning 12 of the remaining
 * 36 block updates are duplicates and thus also redundant.
 *
 * <p>
 * Of the 22 shape updates, only 6 are strictly necessary. The other 16
 * are sent to blocks diagonally above and below. These are necessary
 * if a wire changes its connections, but not when it changes its power
 * level.
 *
 * <p>
 * Redstone wire in Vanilla also fails on point 3, though this is more of
 * a quality-of-life issue than a lag issue. The recursive nature in which
 * it updates, combined with the location-dependent order in which each
 * wire updates its neighbors, makes the order in which neighbors of a
 * wire network are updated incredibly inconsistent and seemingly random.
 *
 * <p>
 * Alternate Current fixes each of these problems as follows.
 *
 * <p>
 * 1.
 * To make sure a wire calculates its power level as little as possible,
 * we remove the recursive nature in which redstone wire updates in
 * Vanilla. Instead, we build a network of connected wires, find those
 * wires that receive redstone power from "outside" the network, and
 * spread the power from there. This has a few advantages:
 * <br>
 * - Each wire checks for power from non-wire components just once, and
 *   from nearby wires just twice.
 * <br>
 * - Each wire only sets its power level in the world once. This is
 *   important, because calls to World.setBlockState are even more
 *   expensive than calls to World.getBlockState.
 *
 * <p>
 * 2.
 * There are 2 obvious ways in which we can reduce the number of block
 * and shape updates.
 * <br>
 * - Get rid of the 18 redundant block updates and 16 redundant shape
 *   updates, so each wire only emits 24 block updates and 6 shape updates
 *   whenever it changes its power level.
 * <br>
 * - Only emit block updates and shape updates once a wire reaches its
 *   final power level, rather than at each intermediary stage.
 * <br>
 * For an individual wire, these two optimizations are the best you can
 * do, but for an entire grid, you can do better!
 *
 * <p>
 * Since we calculate the power of the entire network, sending block and
 * shape updates to the wires in it is redundant. Removing those updates
 * can reduce the number of block and shape updates by up to 20%.
 *
 * <p>
 * 3.
 * To make the order of block updates to neighbors of a network
 * deterministic, the first thing we must do is to replace the location-
 * dependent order in which a wire updates its neighbors. Instead, we
 * base it on the direction of power flow. This part of the algorithm
 * was heavily inspired by theosib's 'RedstoneWireTurbo', which you can
 * read more about in theosib's comment on Mojira
 * <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-420777">here</a>
 * or by checking out its implementation in carpet mod
 * <a href="https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/src/main/java/carpet/helpers/RedstoneWireTurbo.java">here</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The idea is to determine the direction of power flow through a wire
 * based on the power it receives from neighboring wires. For example, if
 * the only power a wire receives is from a neighboring wire to its west,
 * it can be said that the direction of power flow through the wire is east.
 *
 * <p>
 * We make the order of block updates to neighbors of a wire depend on what
 * is determined to be the direction of power flow. This not only removes
 * locationality entirely, it even removes directionality in a large
 * number of cases. Unlike in 'RedstoneWireTurbo', however, I have decided
 * to keep a directional element in ambiguous cases, rather than to
 * introduce randomness, though this is trivial to change.
 *
 * <p>
 * While this change fixes the block update order of individual wires,
 * we must still address the overall block update order of a network. This
 * turns out to be a simple fix, because of a change we made earlier: we
 * search through the network for wires that receive power from outside it,
 * and spread the power from there. If we make each wire transmit its power
 * to neighboring wires in an order dependent on the direction of power
 * flow, we end up with a non-locational and largely non-directional wire
 * update order.
